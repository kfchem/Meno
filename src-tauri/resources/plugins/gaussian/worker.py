"""The Gaussian plugin's worker: a molecule written as Gaussian 16 input, and
a workflow's steps done with Gaussian 16.

A plugin's worker (docs/PLUGINS.md, docs/FILE-IO.md, docs/WORKFLOWS.md),
run in an environment of its own - Python alone, no package. Gaussian
itself is a program installed separately, under its own licence: never
fetched or shipped by Meno, found where the system finds programs or where
the chemist located it (the manifest's `installed`). One JSON object per
line on stdin, one per line back on stdout, as every plugin's:

    {"id": 3, "op": "write", "kind": "gaussian-input", "name": "water.gjf",
     "molecules": [{"name": "water", "atoms": [...], "bonds": [...]}],
     "options": {"job": "opt freq", "method": "B3LYP", ...}}
    {"id": 3, "ok": true, "result": {"text": "..."}}
    {"id": 4, "op": "prepare", "step": "optimise", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "cores": 4}
    {"id": 4, "ok": true, "result": {"jobs": [{"entries": [0], "program": "g16", "args": [], "stdin": "input.gjf", ...}]}}
    {"id": 5, "op": "collect", "step": "optimise", "entries": [...], "files": {}, "log": "...", "ended": "done"}
    {"id": 5, "ok": true, "result": {"read": [{"kind": "gaussian", "log": true, "name": "water.log"}]}}
    {"id": 3, "ok": false, "error": "..."}

It writes what it is given and nothing else - no file of its own choosing,
no network - runs nothing itself, and says when it is ready:

    {"event": "ready", "version": "0.2.0"}

Its steps - Optimise, Energy, Frequencies - each make a job for an entry:
its input written as below, run as Gaussian's "Running Gaussian" page has
it - `g16 <input-file >output-file`: given no job name, Gaussian reads its
input from standard input and writes its output to standard output, which
is the job's log, followed by Meno as it runs; the scratch files where it
runs; its folder `g16root` the one above Gaussian's own and GAUSS_EXEDIR
Gaussian's own. `collect` reads nothing: it says that the log is
Gaussian's output, for Meno's readers to read as one opened is - or,
where the job failed, why, as the output says.

The input is laid out as Gaussian's own reference has it (gaussian.com,
"About Gaussian 16 Input", "Link 0 Commands", "Molecule Specifications"),
and from nothing else:

- Link 0 commands, each a line beginning with "%", not ended by a blank
  line: %Chk names the checkpoint file, %NProcShared the processors a run
  may use, %Mem its memory, a number of 8-byte words or with a unit.
- The route section, begun by "#", ended by a blank line: the method and
  basis set, empirical dispersion (the "EmpiricalDispersion" keyword: GD2,
  GD3 or GD3BJ), the job (SP, Opt, Freq) and any keywords besides.
- The title section, ended by a blank line: at most five lines, none of
  the characters the reference says to avoid (@ # ! an en dash _ \\ and
  control characters).
- The molecule specification, ended by a blank line: the charge and spin
  multiplicity on its first line, then each atom's element and its
  Cartesian coordinates, an isotope as "(Iso=n)" after the element.
