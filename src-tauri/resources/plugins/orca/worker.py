"""The ORCA plugin's worker: steps of a workflow done with ORCA.

A plugin's worker (docs/PLUGINS.md, docs/WORKFLOWS.md), run in an
environment of its own - Python alone, no package. ORCA itself is a
program installed separately, under its own licence: never fetched or
shipped by Meno, found where the system finds programs or where the
chemist located it (the manifest's `installed`). One JSON object per line
each way, as every plugin's:

    {"id": 4, "op": "prepare", "step": "optimise", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "cores": 4}
    {"id": 4, "ok": true, "result": {"jobs": [{"entries": [0], "program": "orca", "args": ["input.inp"], "files": [...], "reads": []}]}}
    {"id": 5, "op": "collect", "step": "optimise", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "files": {...}, "log": "...", "ended": "done"}
    {"id": 5, "ok": true, "result": {"read": [{"kind": "orca", "log": true, "name": "water.out"}]}}

It fills three kinds of step - Optimise, Energy, Frequencies - and runs
nothing itself: `prepare` writes each job's input and says the command
Meno runs, apart from Meno, in the job's folder; `collect` reads nothing
either, but says that what ORCA printed is ORCA's output, for Meno's
readers to read as one opened is - or, where the job failed, why. One job
for each entry.

The input is written as ORCA's own manual has it (ORCA 6.1 Manual,
faccts.de: "General Structure of the Input File", "Parallel and
Multi-Process Modules", "Implicit Solvation Models"), and from nothing
else:

- a simple input line, begun by "!": the method and basis set, a
  dispersion correction (D3BJ, D4), the run - SP, OPT or FREQ - and, for
  implicit solvation, CPCM(solvent) or SMD(solvent);
- %pal nprocs, the processes a run uses, where it may use more than one;
  %maxcore, the memory for each, in MB;
- the coordinates, "* xyz charge multiplicity", an atom a line - its
  element and x, y, z in angstroms - and "*" at their end.

ORCA is run as the manual says: by its full path, given the input file,
printing its output.

It keeps nothing between requests, and reaches no network.
