"""The RDKit plugin's worker: RDKit, answering a fixed set of requests - the
roles it fills for Meno (its manifest; docs/PLUGINS.md).

One JSON object per line on stdin, one per line back on stdout:

    {"id": 7, "op": "to_smiles", "molblock": "..."}
    {"id": 7, "ok": true, "result": {"smiles": "CCO"}}
    {"id": 7, "ok": false, "error": "..."}

It runs no code it is sent - only the operations below - and needs no
network. When RDKit has been imported it says so:

    {"event": "ready", "version": "2026.03.6"}

Structures come in as MOL blocks, V2000 or V3000, and go back as V3000 ones
with their atoms in the order they came in. (Clean-up is Meno's own layout
engine's, in the app: src/lib/layout.) Their 3D structures go back as
atoms, bonds and coordinates: the atoms in the order they came in, the
hydrogens made for them after.
