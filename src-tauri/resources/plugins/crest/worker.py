"""The CREST plugin's worker: a workflow's conformer search done with CREST.

A plugin's worker (docs/PLUGINS.md, docs/WORKFLOWS.md), run in a pixi
environment of its own - CREST, the xtb it runs, and Python from
conda-forge, for macOS and Linux. One JSON object per line each way, as
every plugin's:

    {"id": 4, "op": "prepare", "step": "conformers", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "cores": 4}
    {"id": 4, "ok": true, "result": {"jobs": [{"entries": [0], "program": "crest", "args": [...], "files": [...], "reads": [...]}]}}
    {"id": 5, "op": "collect", "step": "conformers", "entries": [...], "options": {...}, "files": {...}, "log": "...", "ended": "done"}
    {"id": 5, "ok": true, "result": {"outputs": [{...}]}}

It fills two kinds of step - Conformers and Optimise - and runs nothing
itself: `prepare` says what each job is - its input, and the command Meno
runs, apart from Meno, in the job's folder - and `collect` reads back what
a job wrote, as Meno's own output form (lib/calc/output), or says why it
failed. A conformer search is one job for each entry; an optimisation one
job for each molecule's entries together, CREST optimising them all from
one ensemble file.

What CREST is asked, and what is read of what it writes, are as CREST's
own documentation has them (crest-lab.github.io/crest-docs: "Command Line
Keywords", "Coordinate Files", "Conformational Sampling"), and from
nothing else:

- the input as Xmol (XYZ) coordinates in angstroms; `--chrg` the charge,
  `--uhf` the unpaired electrons; `--gfn1`, `--gfn2`, `--gfnff` or
  `--gfn2//gfnff`; `--alpb` a solvent; `--quick`, `--squick` or
  `--mquick` a quicker search; `--ewin` the energy window in kcal/mol;
  `--T` the cores;
- the conformers in `crest_conformers.xyz`, an ensemble file: Xmol
  frames, in angstroms, each one's comment line its energy in hartrees,
  lowest first;
- each conformer's population - its Boltzmann weight at 298.15 K, the
  rotamers that are degenerate forms of it counted in - from the table
  CREGEN prints ("Metadynamics-based Conformational Sampling": the
  columns Erel/kcal, Etot, weight/tot, conformer, set, degen, origin; the
  row that begins each conformer's set of rotamers gives the set's weight,
  its number and its degeneracy), the sets in the order of
  `crest_conformers.xyz`;
- an ensemble optimised with `--mdopt <file>` ("Ensemble Optimization"):
  each structure of the ensemble file given, optimised, written to
  `crest_ensemble.xyz` in the same order, each comment line its energy.

It keeps nothing between requests, and reaches no network.
