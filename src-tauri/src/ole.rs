//! Structures in Word and PowerPoint documents as OLE objects, on Windows:
//! a document keeps Meno's record of the structure with the same EMF picture
//! a copy carries, and a double-click on it opens the structure in Meno,
//! whose edits go back into the document as they are made.
//!
//! Meno is the object's server itself. It registers the class as it starts,
//! so a double-click reaches a Meno that is already running; when none is,
//! Windows starts one (`-Embedding`). The objects are free-threaded: Office's
//! calls arrive on threads of COM's multithreaded apartment, and Meno's
//! calls to Office are made from one such thread too (`OUT`), while the
//! page's commands arrive on the window's thread and hand their work over.
//!
//! The picture is drawn by the page (lib/chem/emf) and handed over with the
//! record; what Office shows is whatever was handed over last.
