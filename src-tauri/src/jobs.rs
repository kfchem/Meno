//! Jobs (docs/WORKFLOWS.md, *What changes in the contract*): a program run
//! for a workflow's step, on this computer, in a folder of its own - started
//! apart from Meno, so that it goes on when Meno closes - its log written
//! as it goes, and how it ended recorded.
//!
//! A job's folder, in Meno's data folder, `jobs/<id>/`:
//!
//! - `job.json` - what to run: the program, its arguments and environment,
//!   how many jobs may run at once, when it was asked for;
//! - `work/` - where it runs: its input, written there before it starts,
//!   and what it writes;
//! - `log.txt` - what it says, its output and its errors, as it goes;
//! - `state.json` - Meno's record of it: waiting, running, done, failed,
//!   stopped - or gone, where what ran it is no longer there;
//! - `runner.lock` - held for as long as its runner is there;
//! - `stop` - there once it has been asked to stop.
//!
//! Meno's own executable runs each job (`--job <folder>`, [`job_mode`]): it
//! waits its turn - jobs start in the order they were asked for, as many at
//! once as was allowed - then runs the program in a process group of its
//! own (a job object on Windows), so that a stop stops it and everything it
//! started; and it writes down how it ended. It shows nothing and needs no
//! Meno: closed, Meno leaves it running, and finds it again from its folder.
//!
//! A job runs only a program a plugin names (its manifest's `steps`, each
//! with the `programs` it needs), from that plugin's environment - Python
//! only with a script of the plugin's - and reaches no network.
