# CTfiles: what Meno reads, draws and writes

Molfiles, SDfiles and Rxnfiles are read after BIOVIA's *CTfile Formats*
(Chemistry 2026), V2000 and V3000 alike, by a reader of Meno's own
(`src/lib/chem/ctfile.ts`). It keeps everything a file says about a
structure; how each part is drawn follows IUPAC's recommendations where they
say anything - *Graphical Representation Standards for Chemical Structure
Diagrams* (2008, GR-) and *Graphical Representation of Stereochemical
Configuration* (2006, ST-) - and Meno's own conventions, written down here,
where they do not. No other program's code or output is a reference for any
of it.

This was built in steps, each adding to what is written here: the reader;
bonds besides plain ones; atoms that are not elements; what is said about
atoms, bonds and structures; Sgroups and haptic bonds; reaction schemes,
written back as RXN files.

## Reading

Everything below is read and kept (`CtMolecule`, carried on a file's
molecule as `Molecule.ct`):

- **Atoms**: coordinates; symbol, or a reserved type (R#, A, Q, X, M, R, *,
  LP) or an atom list (L, `[N,O]`, `NOT [S,Se]`); mass (V2000's mass
  difference and M  ISO, V3000's MASS); charge and radical (V2000's atom
  block and M  CHG / M  RAD, either of which clears the atom block's);
  valence; query hydrogen count; stereo care box; atom-atom mapping;
  inversion/retention; exact change; query substitution, unsaturation and
  ring bond counts; alias (A) and value (V) lines; Rgroup labels
  (M  RGP, RGROUPS) and attachment points and order (M  APO, M  AAL,
  ATTCHPT, ATTCHORD).
- **Bonds**: types 1 to 10 (single, double, triple, aromatic, the four
  query types, coordination, hydrogen); stereo (a single bond's up, down,
  either; a double bond's either - cis or trans, not known); topology;
  reacting centre; stereo care; V3000's haptic endpoints (ENDPTS with
  ATTACH=ALL or ANY) and display (DISP: COORD, DATIVE, HBOND1, HBOND2).
- **Sgroups** of every type - abbreviations (SUP, and the old G line),
  multiple groups, polymers (SRU, MON, MER, COP, CRO, MOD, GRA, ANY), mixtures
  and formulations (COM, MIX, FOR), generic and data Sgroups - with their
  atoms, crossing and containment bonds, labels, subtypes, connectivity,
  brackets and their style, expansion state, attachment points, parents,
  and a data Sgroup's field, data and display.
- **Collections** (V3000): enhanced stereo (MDLV30/STEABS, STERACn,
  STERELn, and the bond collections STEBABS, STEBRACn, STEBRELn),
  highlighting, a file's own.
- **The chiral flag**, link atoms, Rgroup definitions and their logic.
- **Rxnfiles**, V2000 (`$MOL` blocks) and V3000 (BEGIN REACTANT / PRODUCT /
  REAGENT blocks), their molecules in the file's order: reactants,
  products, then reagents.

Not read: V3000 3D blocks and templates (SCSR), RDfiles and XDfiles.

## Drawing

| What | How | Why |
|---|---|---|
| A double bond of either configuration | The double bond as it is, and a wavy bond on a single substituent beside it: never on a bond to another stereocentre; on both substituents of an end that has two, where no end has one free; none where the drawing shows no configuration anyway (a substituent straight on, or an end with none). | IUPAC ST-4.4 prefers this; it does not accept a crossed double bond for general use. |
| A hydrogen bond (type 10) | Dotted: round dots a line and a half wide, three line widths apart, at least three. | GR-1.8: partial bonds dotted, at least three dots; GR-1.3: gaps of 2 to 4 line widths. |
| A coordination bond shown as COORD | A plain line. | GR-1.7: coordination bonds plain; dashed not acceptable. |
| A coordination bond otherwise (type 9, or DATIVE) | A dative arrow, from the first atom to the second, as before. | |
| A query bond (types 5 to 8) | The first kind it stands for - single, or double for "double or aromatic" - labelled small beside its middle on the side with more room: S/D, S/A, D/A, Any. | GR-11.2: a bond's annotation by its middle, smaller than an atom's label. Meno's own labels. |

Neither a hydrogen bond nor a coordination bond takes a hydrogen from the
atoms at its ends, as a dative bond does not: an ammine stays NH3.

### Atoms that are not elements

| What | How | Why |
|---|---|---|
| An Rgroup (R# with M  RGP / RGROUPS) | R with its number superscript: R¹, R¹,². Typed as R1. | GR-9.1: a superscript number; a subscript is not acceptable, being read as a count. |
| An atom list (L with M  ALS, or V3000's [..]) | The list in brackets, [N,O]; NOT [N,O] for a NOT list. | GR-9.1: a list in a label is enclosed in brackets. |
| An alias (A line) | The atom is drawn as - and taken to be - its alias. | |
| A contracted abbreviation (SUP not expanded, or the old G line) | One atom, labelled, where the group's first attachment is, holding the atoms and bonds it stands for (`abbrev`); its bonds out leave from it. *Expand abbreviation*, in its menu, draws them out, turned with its bond. | |
| An expanded abbreviation | Its atoms. | |
| Any other label - an abbreviation, a class (Nu, Alk), a reserved type (A, Q, X, M, R, *) | Its counts subscript (CO2Me), a sign at its end its charge; read outward from its bond when that comes in from the right: TBSO, MeO2C, BocHN, F3C. No hydrogens of its own. | GR-2.3. |
| The prefixes n-, s-, t-, sec-, tert-, i- (hyphenated) and o-, m-, p- | In italics: *t*-Bu, *s*-Bu, *p*-Ts; iPr and iBu upright, unhyphenated. The canvas leans the label's own letters; an SVG or EMF asks for the typeface's italic. | Table II sets them so, and prefers it (upright is acceptable); the names have them so (isopropyl, *tert*-butyl). |
| A substituted aryl group named ring last (2,6-diMeBz, 4-MeOC6H4) | As written on either side of its bond - it is not read outward - the ring's group, or a formula's C6, at the bond when that comes in from the right. Positions are no counts: not subscript. | Meno's own: such labels name the ring last. |
| A valence the file sets (V2000's vvv, V3000's VAL) | Hydrogens counted to it; a carbon of other than four shows its label, CH2. | |
| A query hydrogen count | Kept, and written back; not drawn. | |

### What is said about atoms, bonds and structures

Annotations are set smaller than labels, close to what they are about and in
the most open space beside it (IUPAC GR-11.1, GR-11.2); what is said about a
whole structure is set beneath it, half a bond and more clear of it, as
large as its labels (GR-11.3).

| What | How | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Atom-atom mapping | The number, small, beside the atom. | GR-11.1 |
| Inversion or retention | "inv" or "ret" beside the atom. | Meno's own words for the format's flag. |
| Exact change | "exact" beside the atom. | Meno's own. |
| Reacting centre: bond made or broken (4) | Two short strokes across the bond's middle. | Meno's own marks. |
| Reacting centre: order changes (8) | One stroke. | Meno's own. |
| Reacting centre: both (12) | Three strokes. (5, 9 and 13 as 4, 8 and 12.) | Meno's own. |
| Not a reacting centre (-1) | A small cross on the bond's middle. | Meno's own. |
| A reacting centre otherwise (1), or no change (2) | "rc", "nc" beside the bond's middle. | Meno's own. |
| An enhanced stereo group taking in all a structure's centres | Racemic (AND): "and enantiomer" beneath it; relative (OR): "or enantiomer"; absolute: nothing. | ST-6.3 prefers text beside the diagram; ST-6.5 rules out "rac" and "rel" as labels; ST-6.2: a diagram with no indicator shows the configuration drawn. |
| Groups that do not (more than one in a structure, or of stereo bonds) | Each centre or stereo bond labelled small: abs, and1, or2. | ST-0.8 finds no consensus on how mixtures of diastereoisomers are depicted; these are Meno's, after the format's own names. |

A file with stereo bonds and the chiral flag set but no collections has
each of its stereocentres (where a wedge starts) taken as absolute, as the
format says the flag applies; one without the flag, as drawn (ST-6.2).

### Sgroups and haptic bonds

A file's Sgroups - all but a contracted abbreviation - are kept as marks
on their atoms (`SgroupMark`), the same on each, so that they go where the
atoms go; their brackets are worked out from where the atoms are, not
taken from the file's coordinates.

| What | How | Why |
|---|---|---|
| A polymer or other bracketed group (SRU, COP, MON, MER, CRO, MOD, GRA, COM, MIX, FOR, ANY, GEN) | A bracket across each bond out of the group at its middle, its ends turned in towards it; for a group with no bond out, one either side of it. Parentheses where the file says so (SBT, BRKTYP). | Meno's drawing of the format's brackets. |
| What the group is | Small, at the last bracket's lower outside end: an SRU's subscript (n, as the file has it); co, alt, ran, block for a copolymer by its subtype; graft, mon, mer, xl (crosslink), mod, c and its number (component), mix, f (formulation), any; a generic group's label. Its connectivity, hh or ht, at the upper end (EU says nothing). | IUPAC's polymer words where they have one (co, alt, ran, block, graft); Meno's otherwise. |
| A data Sgroup (DAT) | Its data, and units, small beneath its atoms. Where the file places it is not followed. | |
| A multiple group (MUL) | Its atoms, expanded, as the file holds them; no bracket. | Drawn contracted, the repeats would have to be hidden and their bonds redrawn; expanded, the drawing is the structure. |
| An abbreviation shown expanded | Its atoms; written back as the expanded abbreviation it was. | |
| A haptic bond (V3000 ENDPTS) | A plain line to the star atom at the pi system's centre, the star drawn as nothing - to all its atoms (ATTACH=ALL) or any one (ANY, a variable attachment). | GR-1.7: coordination to contiguous atoms drawn to show it; GR-9.4. |

**The abbreviations Meno knows** (`src/lib/chem/abbreviations.ts`) are its
own list, compiled from what chemists commonly write, not taken from any
program's table: IUPAC's Table II (GR-2.2) - Me, Et, Pr, iPr, Bu, iBu,
s-Bu, t-Bu, Ac, Ph, Ms, Ts, Cp, marked as free to use - the protecting
groups and substituents of everyday use and the less common ones too
(peptide synthesis's Pbf, Pmc, Mtr, Mtt, Mmt, Dde, ivDde, Acm, Xan, Dmb;
NAP, POM, EE, Lev, Ses and their like), the leaving groups of active
esters (Su, Pfp, Bt, At: OSu, OPfp), and contracted labels such as CO2H,
NO2, NMe2 and NPhth. Each one's formula, worked out from its structure, is
checked against its name in the tests. Each has its structure, in SMILES
(`src/lib/chem/smiles.ts` reads it), and may have other names (TBDMS for
TBS, p-Ts and Tos for Ts, Bzl for Bn, C6H5 for Ph, C6F5 for Pfp).

What is put together from them is read by rule, not listed:

- a group or contracted label behind O, S or NH - OTBS, SPh, NHBoc, OCF3 -
  but Cp, which Table II allows only bonded to a metal;
- an ester, CO2 and a group - CO2Me, CO2t-Bu;
- a substituted aryl group (`src/lib/chem/substitutedAryl.ts`): positions,
  a multiplying prefix (di, tri, tetra, penta) and a substituent before Ph,
  Bz (benzoyl) or Bn - 2,6-diMeBz, 4-MeO-3-NO2Ph, p-ClBn - or before the
  ring written as a formula, with their counts - 4-MeOC6H4, 2,6-Me2C6H3,
  3,5-(CF3)2C6H3. The substituents are Me, Et, iPr, t-Bu, Ph, F, Cl, Br,
  I, CF3, OMe, OEt, OCF3, OH, OAc, OBn, NO2, CN, NH2, NMe2, NHAc, SMe, Ac
  and CO2Me, each either way round (MeO, OMe). Positions must lie on the
  ring (2 to 6, o-, m-, p-), once each; counts must match them, and a
  formula's hydrogens make up the rest.

**Ligands and complexes** (`src/lib/chem/ligands.ts`). The ligands of
transition-metal chemistry are known by their labels, each the molecule it
is, in SMILES, its donor atoms marked by atom class ([P:1], [P:2] for a
chelating diphosphine; several atoms of one class for a pi system bound
through all of them): phosphines, arsines and phosphites (PPh3, PCy3,
P(t-Bu)3, P(o-Tol)3, TFP, AsPh3 ...), Buchwald's biaryl phosphines
(XPhos, SPhos, RuPhos, BrettPhos, tBuXPhos, DavePhos, JohnPhos, and the
less common CyJohnPhos, MePhos, tBuMePhos, tBuDavePhos, PhDavePhos, CPhos,
tBuBrettPhos, AdBrettPhos, RockPhos, Me4tBuXPhos, EPhos, GPhos, sSPhos),
chelating diphosphines
(dppm to dppb, dppf, BINAP, SEGPHOS, DTBM-SEGPHOS, Xantphos, DPEphos), N
donors (bpy, dtbpy, phen, py, TMEDA, en, MeCN), chiral diamines (DPEN,
TsDPEN, DACH), salen, N-heterocyclic carbenes (IPr, IMes, SIPr, SIMes), pi
ligands (cod, nbd, dba, p-cymene, Cp*, dvtms), acac and THF; and, in a
complex's formula only, CO, H2O, NH3, Cp (η⁵), allyl (η³) and the
alkylidenes =CHPh and =CH2, bound by a double bond. A label bonded to a
metal binds it as the ligand does when it is expanded or written out: a
neutral donor by a coordination bond from it (drawn, as before, as a plain
line), an anionic one (acac's O, TsDPEN's sulfonamide N) by a bond, a pi
system by a haptic bond to the star at its centre. A chiral ligand is
given as one enantiomer, and named as one by its descriptor:
(S,S)-DPEN, (R,R)-DPEN (see *Configurations* below). Each ligand's formula,
and that each of its ring bonds is in a ring of five or six (cod's of
eight), is checked in the tests.

A complex's formula is read as the structure it stands for - Pd(PPh3)4,
PdCl2(dppf), Pd2(dba)3, Pd(OAc)2, Cp2ZrCl2, [Ir(cod)Cl]2, [Rh(cod)2]BF4,
Mo(CO)6 - from its metals (the d block and the lanthanides), its ligands in
parentheses or not, halides, hydrides and groups bound by one bond (OAc,
OTf, Me), a part in brackets made as many times as its count, and the
counter-anions after it, each leaving a positive charge on the part's
metal: read by rule as a salt's anion is (BF4, PF6, SbF6, AsF6, BPh4,
ClO4; see below), or BArF, which names its aryl groups by no formula, from
a list. A ligand written as an anion (Cp⁻, Cp*⁻) leaves its charge on the
metal, so that the whole is as charged as the formula says. A ligand in
brackets may have its descriptor: RuCl[(S,S)-TsDPEN](p-cymene),
RuCl2[(S)-BINAP][(S,S)-DPEN]. Where one part
has several metals - Pd2(dba)3 - the ligands are shared among them in
turn: which bridge them, a formula does not say, unless it marks one with
μ (IUPAC's mark for a bridging ligand): a bridging ligand's donors are
bound to the metals in turn - Karstedt's Pt2(dvtms)2(μ-dvtms) - and a
bridging halide or group to each of them. A complex written out is V3000,
its coordination bonds needing it. Expanded on the canvas it is laid out
by Meno's engine, which is not yet made for coordination compounds: the
drawing of a large complex is crowded.

**Reagents** (`src/lib/chem/reagents.ts`). The reagents, catalysts and
solvents written over reaction arrows are known by their labels, each the
whole molecule it is, so that a scheme's conditions are structures too:
oxidants (DMP, IBX, PIDA, TEMPO, PCC, TPAP, NMO, mCPBA, DDQ, Oxone, OsO4
...), reductants (LAH, STAB, DIBAL, L-Selectride, 9-BBN, B2pin2 ...),
bases (DBU, DMAP, DIPEA, TEA, LDA, LiHMDS ...), acids (TFA, PTSA,
CSA, PPTS), coupling reagents (DCC, EDC, HATU, COMU, PyBOP, T3P, DPPA, DEAD
...), halogenating and fluorinating ones (NBS, Selectfluor, NFSI, DAST,
Togni I and II ...), electrophiles (TFAA, Comins' reagent, Meerwein's salt
...), organometallic reagents and metal catalysts (Tebbe, Petasis,
Schwartz, Stryker; Grubbs I to III, Hoveyda–Grubbs I and II, Schrock,
Wilkinson, Crabtree, PEPPSI-IPr, Jacobsen, Karstedt and Krische's
π-allyliridium C,O-benzoate), organocatalysts and chiral reagents (proline,
MacMillan's, Hayashi–Jørgensen, CBS, Shi's ketone), solvents (DMF, DMSO,
NMP, DCM, dioxane, toluene ...) and named reagents (Burgess, Martin's
sulfurane, Lawesson's, Bestmann–Ohira, TBAF). Each is written in SMILES - a
salt as its ions after dots - or, a metal's complex, as its formula, read
as complexes are, from Meno's ligands and any of its own (Hoveyda's
chelating benzylidene; Krische's 3-nitrobenzoate, as the catalyst is sold,
bound by its carboxylate and the ortho carbon away from the nitro group).
The tests check each one's formula against its name. Its labels may be
written with an apostrophe or a dash either way (Comins' or Comins’,
Hoveyda-Grubbs or Hoveyda–Grubbs). A reagent's name is one unit of a label,
its digits not counts (T3P, 9-BBN); a formula's are (NaBH4, B2pin2).

The list holds only what no rule reads: Ac2O, Boc2O, Tf2O, TfOH, TsOH,
HOBt, KOt-Bu, NaH, EtOAc, NaBH4, LiAlH4, NaIO4 and K2CO3 are read by rule
(below), not listed - and the tests check that no name in it is read by
rule as the same molecule.
Settings › Dictionary shows every entry of it, Meno's groups and
ligands (by family, the Buchwald ligands one of them), the counter-anion
no rule reads (BArF), and Buchwald's precatalysts by generation - what
each label is, drawn as it comes into view; how labels are read is
documented here, not there.

Read by rule, besides, as whole molecules:

- a simple formula (`src/lib/chem/condensed.ts`): read into groups and
  elements with their counts, it is a molecule where one atom of valence
  two or more has as many groups and univalent atoms as its valence - Et3N,
  i-Pr2NEt, MeMgBr, Bu3SnH, CH2Cl2, MeOH, Ac2O, (Boc)2O - or two univalent
  parts are joined - n-BuLi, TMSCl, TBSOTf, Fmoc-OSu, HCl. Sodium and
  potassium are bound as ions, lithium so but to carbon: NaOMe is Na⁺ and
  MeO⁻, NaN3 Na⁺ and azide, n-BuLi keeps its C-Li bond. A label with a bond
  left free (OMe, NMe2, CH2Br) is no such formula, and stays a group;
- a salt (`src/lib/chem/formula.ts`): alkali metals, and the rest an anion
  of as many charges - NaBH4, LiAlH4, NaBH(OAc)3, NaBF4, NaIO4, NaClO2,
  CF3SO2Na, K2CO3, NaHCO3, K3PO4. An anion has one centre, and round it
  oxygens, hydrogens and parts bound by one bond. With no oxygen, it is an
  ate anion: a centre with no lone pair left at a valence of its own takes
  one part more and the charge (BF4⁻, PF6⁻, SbF6⁻, BPh4⁻, BH4⁻, AlH4⁻).
  With oxygens, they are bound by double bonds but one for each charge,
  which carries it, and one for each hydrogen, which is theirs (ClO4⁻,
  IO4⁻, CO3²⁻, HCO3⁻) - as many bonds as a valence of the centre's own:
  below the second row P(V), S(IV) and S(VI), Cl(I) to Cl(VII) too, and in
  it no more than four bonds (no NO3⁻ so). A group in parentheses is one
  part, as counted: NaBH(OAc)3, and Pb(OAc)4 as a molecule;
- an adduct of known parts, a middle dot between them, each counted:
  BF3·OEt2, CeCl3·7H2O, EDC·HCl;
- a Buchwald precatalyst named by its phosphine and generation - XPhos Pd
  G2, SPhos-Pd-G3, RuPhos Pd G4 - as its palladacycle: the phosphine, a
  2-aminobiphenyl's carbon and nitrogen, and a chloride (G2) or a mesylate
  (G3; G4's amine N-methylated).

**Configurations.** A stereocentre in SMILES, @ or @@, is read as the
configuration Meno's layout engine takes (`readSmiles`: its neighbours in
OpenSMILES's order, put in the engine's, the H last). A chiral reagent or
ligand is given as one enantiomer, with the descriptors that name it and
its mirror image: (S,S)-DPEN and (R,R)-DPEN, (1S)-CSA, L- and D-proline,
(R)- and (S)-CBS, (R,R)- and (S,S)-Jacobsen's catalyst. Its label alone
says no configuration, and none is drawn - unless its name is of one
enantiomer (Shi's ketone, made from D-fructose); (±) says none too. An
axially chiral one - BINAP, SEGPHOS, DTBM-SEGPHOS, and so Krische's
catalyst and RuCl2[(S)-BINAP][(S,S)-DPEN] - has its axis given with it,
which SMILES has no way to say: the bond C1-C1' (BINAP's), and the
P-bearing carbon at each end, CIP's first, turned as (R) is - M, a
negative torsion between those two. (S) turns it the other way. Written
out, the axis is drawn by one wedge out of an end of it, narrow there, on
the single bond to a neighbour that stands out of the page (or hashes,
behind it), the other ring's in the page, as an atropisomer's wedge is
read (RDKit reads Meno's (R)-BINAP as M and (S)- as P; checked locally).
Clean-up reads it back from that wedge and keeps it (`drawn.ts`); a MOL
file has it as that wedge. Written out, a stereocentre is drawn as Clean-up draws it,
by the same engine: a wedge on a bond out of its rings, its narrow end at
the centre, an H drawn where it has no other way, or - in a cage - the
perspective drawing itself; Clean-up reads the configuration back from it
as the one given (tested). A cage's, shown by its perspective with no
wedge, is not yet written to a MOL file, as with any cage Clean-up draws.

**Hydrogens drawn as said.** Where a structure says an atom has more H
than its valence leaves - Bu3SnH's tin, a metal's hydride, LiAlH4's
aluminium - the rest are drawn as atoms; where fewer, it is a radical if
one short (TEMPO's oxygen), and else keeps the valence it has. A carbon at
either end of a coordination or a dative bond is the one lending its pair -
an NHC's or a carbene's, CO's - and the pair is two of its valence, so it
carries no H for it (`molecule.valenceOrder`); any other atom's lent pair
takes none, as before.

**Abbreviations of the user's own** are kept in Settings › Dictionary
(`settings.json`): a label, other ways of writing it, a name, and the
structure as SMILES with a "*" where it is attached, drawn as it is typed.
A group on a canvas can be saved as one too: selected, *Save as
abbreviation…* in its menu takes its structure (written by Meno's own
SMILES writer, `writeSmiles`), and shows the atoms as the new label unless
asked not to. A label of one's own may not be an element's symbol, nor one
that already means something - Meno's, one put together by rule, or
another of one's own - as IUPAC (GR-2.2) does not accept either. Once
saved it is known as Meno's own are, and stands behind O, S or NH and in an
ester as a group does.

A label known any of these ways can be expanded, is counted and written out
whole, and is what RDKit is asked about; one not known is text. Ar is
argon's symbol as well as aryl's (GR-9.2): typed, it is argon. Settings ›
Abbreviations shows Meno's list, each drawn as what it stands for.

A bond that came from a file as one of these becomes an ordinary bond once
its order or stereo is changed in the editor.

### Reaction schemes

An Rxnfile says which molecules are reactants, products and reagents, and
nothing of how the reaction is drawn; IUPAC's recommendations say nothing of
a scheme's layout either. Meno lays one out after the usual practice of
journals:

| What | How |
|---|---|
| Reactants, products | Along one line, each centred on it: the reactants, the arrow, the products. A bond and a quarter apart, as drawn, labels and all. |
| "+" | Between each two molecules on one side of the arrow, on its line. A cross about as wide as the sign set in the labels' typeface (0.6 of their font size), its bars as thick as a bond's line, in the bonds' colour. |
| Reagents | Above the arrow, side by side, their lowest point two fifths of a bond above it - clear of its head. |
| The arrow | Two and two-thirds of a bond long, or half a bond longer than the reagents above it are wide on either side. Its line and head as the drawing style has them, or as the arrow sets for itself. |

An arrow and a "+" can also be added - from the menu a right-click on
empty space opens - moved and deleted, and an arrow drawn out by either
end (docs/EDITOR-2D.md). The arrows and pluses drawn
among a selection go with it: they are copied, cut, deleted and moved with
it (but not turned). Pictures - SVG, and the EMF and PNG a copy puts on the
clipboard - show them, and Meno's own record of a copied drawing keeps
them.

## Writing

Every Sgroup goes back with its type, atoms, bonds out, label or
multiplier, subtype, connectivity, bracket style, parent, component number,
expansion state and data, and its brackets where Meno draws them; a haptic
bond with its endpoints (V3000).

Mapping numbers, inversion and retention, exact change and reacting
centres go in their fields. Enhanced stereo is written as V3000 collections
- V2000 says only the chiral flag, set where every group is absolute.

An abbreviation is written out - the atoms a file gave it, or the
dictionary's, laid out by Meno's own engine on from its bond - with an
abbreviation Sgroup labelling them, so that it reads back contracted. A
label the dictionary does not know is a star atom with an alias (V2000), or
an abbreviation Sgroup of its one star atom (V3000, which has no alias). An
Rgroup, an atom list, a valence and a query hydrogen count go in their
fields. V3000 lines longer than 80 characters are continued, as the format
has it.

A drawing with one arrow is saved as an RXN file (*Save* to a name ending
`.rxn`, offered first for a drawing with an arrow), and a copy of a
reaction puts one on the clipboard beside the MOL file - as
`chemical/x-mdl-rxnfile` - for chemistry programs that take one; a paste
reads one back as a scheme. Which molecule is which is read from the
drawing:

- a molecule is the atoms its bonds join - a haptic bond's to the atoms it
  reaches, an Sgroup's atoms to one another - and two of those in one role
  are one molecule, a salt drawn as its ions, where they lie less than a
  bond apart with no "+" between them;
- a molecule before the arrow's tail, along the arrow, is a reactant; past
  its point, a product; alongside it, above or below, a reagent;
- each in the order drawn along the arrow, reagents above it before those
  below.

The file is V2000 - $MOL blocks, each a MOL file - where every molecule can
be written V2000, and V3000 - a CTAB for each in REACTANT, PRODUCT and
REAGENT blocks - where one cannot. The reagents' count is left out where
there are none, which the format reads as none. A drawing with no arrow, or
more than one, is not saved as an RXN file: the save says why.

MOL files are written V2000 where that can say everything, and V3000
where it cannot: a coordination or hydrogen bond (V2000's types stop at 8),
and whether a coordination bond is shown plainly (DISP=COORD). A query bond
is written with its query type, and a double bond of either configuration
as V2000's stereo 3, V3000's CFG=2. What RDKit is asked about takes a query
bond as the bond it is drawn as.
