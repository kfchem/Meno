# Releasing Meno

A release is a draft on the project's GitHub Releases, built by
`.github/workflows/release.yml` from a tag. The Menos already installed
look for `latest.json` there (`src-tauri/src/update.rs`) and update
themselves - so nothing reaches them until the draft is published.

## Once: the updater's signing key

Every update is signed, and an installed Meno installs only what its
public key (`plugins.updater.pubkey` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`)
checks. The private key is the maintainer's, and stays out of the
repository.

1. Make the key pair, choosing a password when asked:

   ```bash
   npx tauri signer generate -w "$HOME/.tauri/meno-updater.key"
   ```

   This writes the private key (`meno-updater.key`) and the public key
   (`meno-updater.key.pub`).
2. Keep the private key and its password somewhere safe, with a copy
   elsewhere. Losing them means the Menos installed can no longer be
   updated: they would have to be installed again by hand. (A new key can
   be brought in by an update signed with the old one, which carries the
   new public key.)
3. On GitHub, under Settings › Secrets and variables › Actions, add two
   repository secrets: `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` (the private key file's
   contents) and `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` (its password).
4. Put the public key file's contents in `plugins.updater.pubkey`.

This is not code signing (Authenticode, Apple's Developer ID): without
that, Windows' SmartScreen warns about an installer downloaded for the
first time, and macOS will not open Meno until it is let through once
(see The Mac, below). Updates themselves are checked with the updater's
key, whether or not the apps are code-signed, and code signing can be
taken up, or dropped, at any release.

## Each release

1. On a branch: raise the version, the same in both `package.json` and
   `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (the app takes its version from `package.json`),
   and merge it into `main` as usual. Before that, see which files Meno
   carries no longer since the last release, and add each to the Windows
   installer's hook (see *What an installed Meno does*, below):

   ```bash
   git diff --name-status --diff-filter=DR "$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)" -- src-tauri/resources
   ```
2. Tag `main` with the version, prefixed `v`, and push the tag:

   ```bash
   git tag v0.2.0 origin/main
   git push origin v0.2.0
   ```

   The workflow refuses a tag that is not the version in both files.
3. The workflow builds the Windows installer (NSIS, per user) and its
   update, then the Mac's disk image and its update, signs the updates,
   and puts them all on a **draft** release with `latest.json`, which
   names an update for each (`windows-x86_64`, `darwin-aarch64`). The Mac
   job waits for the Windows one: each reads `latest.json`, adds its own
   and puts it back whole. Each job then checks that its update's
   signature names the version it is released as (see below).
4. If the run passed: try the draft's installers, write the release notes
   on the release page if you like, and publish it. The Menos installed
   find it the next time they look - as they start, and every few hours.
   Never publish the draft of a run that failed. (Editing the notes does
   not change `latest.json`, whose `notes` were written as the workflow
   ran; Meno does not show them for now.)

An installed Meno checks more than the signature itself: the signature's
trusted comment must carry the version `latest.json` announces
(`requireSignedVersion` in `tauri.conf.json`), so that an older release
cannot be passed off as a newer one. The Tauri CLI writes that version
from 2.12 on; an update signed without it is refused by every Meno from
0.1.1 on, which is what each job's last step guards against.

## The Mac

The workflow builds Meno for Apple silicon only. Meno carries no `uv`: it
fetches the build pinned for the computer it runs on (`src-tauri/src/tools.rs`),
so an Intel build would need only its own runner.

It is signed **ad hoc** (`signingIdentity: "-"`, in the job's arguments),
the whole bundle, and not with Apple's Developer ID, which the project has
not taken up. Without that the bundle would carry only the linker's
signature on its executable, which macOS takes for a damaged app: a Meno
downloaded that way cannot be opened at all ("“Meno” is damaged and can't
be opened"), short of clearing its quarantine in a terminal.

Signed ad hoc, as seen on macOS 26 (with a local update standing in for
a release's):

- **The first time**, macOS will not open it: "“Meno” Not Opened - Apple
  could not verify “Meno” is free of malware...", with *Done* and *Move to
  Trash*. Apple's way to let it through, since macOS 15 (a right-click ›
  Open no longer does it): drag Meno from the disk image into
  Applications and open it there, choose *Done*, then in System Settings ›
  Privacy & Security choose *Open Anyway* for Meno, give the password
  asked for, and open it. Once is enough.
- **Updates** are not asked about: Meno downloads them itself, so macOS
  does not take them for something from the internet (the app put in
  place carries no quarantine). The app is replaced where it is as Meno
  quits, or restarts into it, and opens as before.
- **Where Meno cannot write** to the folder it is in - a user who is not
  an administrator, with Meno in Applications - macOS asks for an
  administrator's name and password as Meno quits with an update; cancelled,
  Meno stays as it was. Meno opened straight from the disk image cannot
  replace itself; nor, perhaps, one opened from Downloads without being
  moved first, which macOS may run from a read-only copy.
- An ad hoc signature changes with every build, so a permission macOS
  keeps for Meno (a protected folder, say) may be asked for again after an
  update. A Developer ID signature would keep them.

### Taking up Apple's signing

1. Join the Apple Developer Program (99 USD a year in 2026) and, as the
   account holder, make a *Developer ID Application* certificate; export
   it with its key as a `.p12`.
2. For notarization, make an App Store Connect API key (Users and Access ›
   Integrations), or an app-specific password for the Apple Account.
3. Add repository secrets for the job's `env`: `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` (the
   `.p12`, base64), `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` (any,
   for the build's own keychain) and `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`; and
   `APPLE_API_ISSUER`, `APPLE_API_KEY` and the key file (written out for
   `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH`) - or `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD` and
   `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.
4. Take `"macOS":{"signingIdentity":"-"}` out of the job's arguments.

`tauri build` then signs Meno with the certificate and has Apple notarize
it; macOS opens it without asking, and keeps its permissions across
updates. The `uv` inside is already signed and notarized by its makers.

## What an installed Meno does

- It looks only when the user has allowed it (the `app-update` purpose,
  asked once) and Meno is not offline; each connection is shown and
  recorded like any other (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, The network).
- A newer version is downloaded in the background and checked against the
  public key; it is installed as Meno quits (on Windows, the NSIS
  installer, quietly; on a Mac, the app replaced where it is), or at once
  through a restart the user asks for.
- On Windows, the installer registers Meno's class for Office again (its
  `--register-ole` hook), so structures in documents keep opening in the
  Meno installed.
- On Windows, an installer over an earlier version leaves the files that
  version had and this one has not; its hook (`src-tauri/windows/hooks.nsh`)
  deletes those, each by name - since 0.1.8, the uv, RDKit lock and
  chemistry worker 0.1.6 and before carried; since 0.1.9, the Gaussian
  input plugin's files 0.1.7 carried (`resources\plugins\gaussian-input`,
  its folder too, once empty). **A release that stops carrying a file
  adds it there.** (A Mac's app is replaced whole.)
- On Windows, the installer it ran stays in the temporary folder
  (`%TEMP%\Meno-<version>-updater-…`, some 17 MB), since Meno has ended
  by then; the next Meno to start takes it away, once it is ten minutes
  old. A Mac leaves nothing behind: Meno itself unpacks the update and
  puts it in place, and the temporary folders it used go with it.
