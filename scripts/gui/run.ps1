<#
.SYNOPSIS
Run a scenario against the built app and keep what it saw.

.DESCRIPTION
Starts Meno, puts its window at a fixed size, runs the named scenario and
writes its screenshots into a run folder. The scenario is an ordinary script
with the verbs of the platform module available - MenoGui.psm1 on Windows,
MenoGui.macOS.psm1 on a Mac - plus Start-Meno / Open-MenoFile / Save-MenoFile / Save-Step from
here.

This needs a desktop: a logged-in session that is unlocked. It cannot run in
CI, which is why nothing in the workflow calls it.

.EXAMPLE
pwsh scripts/gui/run.ps1 -Scenario drag-atoms
pwsh scripts/gui/run.ps1 -Scenario drag-atoms -Out .gui-runs/before

    <#

      A screenshot, numbered in the order it was taken and named for what

    <#
      .SYNOPSIS
      The copies of Meno running as the app - not those running a job
      (`Meno --job <folder>`, src-tauri/src/jobs.rs), which outlive the
      app and are left to finish.

function Start-Meno {
    <#
      .SYNOPSIS
      Start the app under test, and see off any copy already running: a
      second instance would put its window over the one being driven.

function Open-MenoFile {
    <#
      .SYNOPSIS
      Open a structure through the app's own Open: Ctrl+O (Cmd+O on a Mac).

      .DESCRIPTION
      The file opens in a tab of its own, or in place of the tab in front if
      that is a canvas nothing is drawn on - the first tab, as Meno starts.

      The file picker is the system dialog, so the path is typed into it
      rather than clicked for - how, is the platform module's business. The
      app takes no file on its command line yet; if it ever does, this becomes
      one argument to Start-Meno and the most brittle step in the harness goes
      away.

function Invoke-MenoQuickAdd {
    <#
      .SYNOPSIS
      Quick Add at a point of empty space, and one of its icons:
      Invoke-MenoQuickAdd -X 1300 -Y 1300 -Item Chain begins a chain there,
      which the pointer then leads with the button up until a click ends it.

      .DESCRIPTION
      A double-click at the point opens Quick Add, and the icon is clicked
      where src/ui/features/Workspace/quickAddPlace.ts puts it: up and to
      the right of the point, or below it or to its left where the canvas
      has no room for it at its largest - its calculations or its SMILES
      field open - held there by its top left corner (OFF 14, SIZE 36, a
      border of 1 and padding of 4, icons 2 apart - CSS px, twice as many in
      a shot; the canvas begins under the 40 px title bar). Its
      calculations' size depends on the plugins added: -CalcRows rows of
      steps (and procedures), at most -CalcMost icons in one - Meno's three,
      alone, by default. Change this with that. SMILES opens the field below
      the row, which then takes the keys.

function Add-MenoSmiles {
    <#
      .SYNOPSIS
      A structure from a SMILES, by Quick Add's SMILES field, centred at a
      point of empty space - the middle of the canvas unless told - and let
      go of (it comes in selected, as a paste does). The first one waits

function Save-MenoFile {
    <#
      .SYNOPSIS
      Save the canvas in front under a path, through Save As
      (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+S).

      .DESCRIPTION
      Save As asks where whatever the canvas was saved as before, so a
      scenario says where. The dialog is the system's, so the path is typed
      into it - how, is the platform module's business.
