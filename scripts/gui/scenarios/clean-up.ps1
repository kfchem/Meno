# Clean-up by Meno's own layout engine, and a SMILES drawn by it.
#
# - A taxol drawn anyhow, its wedges on: cleaned up, it comes out as the
#   engine draws it, every stereocentre as it was, in one undo step.
# - Cocaine from its SMILES: its tropane cage in perspective, a bond broken
#   where it passes behind another; its centres shown by the drawing itself
#   (with R/S on, RDKit reads them as 1R,2R,3S,5S). The SMILES needs RDKit,
#   set up on first use.
#
# R/S labels show if they are on (Show R and S in the menu on empty space;
# the setting stays), which this leaves alone. Clean-up is its key,
# Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+K, with nothing selected and the pointer on nothing:
# everything drawn.
