# A long press, and chains on their honeycomb.
#
# - A long press on an atom selects its whole structure - the selection
#   spreading out from the atom as it is held - and a drag from there moves
#   the structure; one undo puts it back. Let go where it was held, it
#   selects and that is all: no label is edited once the double-click
#   time is over.
# - Three clicks on an atom, the third dragged: a chain out of it along the
#   honeycomb that opens out from the atom; led back - a little beside the
#   way it went - it takes its bonds back, and closes no ring for that.
# - Two clicks on empty space, then the pointer led with the button up: a
#   chain from that point; led round in a loop back to it, the ring the
#   honeycomb makes that way - a chain draws no other (0.1.8); a click ends it.
# - Escape lets a chain go: nothing is drawn.
# - A long press on empty space: a ring spreads where it is held, and a drag
#   from there is a box.
#
# Coordinates are read off the opened shot on a Mac (2560x1720), as
# draw-strokes' are: a bond there is about 97 pixels.
