 * Meno's own pointers, in place of the system's hands and arrows wherever
 * Meno asks for one of its own (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, *Pointers*): each says
 * what a drag there does - turns a molecule, moves it, slides sideways -
 * drawn as Meno draws, dark with a white edge to be seen on anything. The
 * plain arrow and the text cursor stay the system's, as the chemist has set
 * them up.
 *
 * Asked for by `data-cursor` on an element (`setCursor`, or the attribute
 * itself); the rules are written once, as Meno starts (`installCursors`). Each is an SVG, at the
 * screen's own scale where the webview takes `image-set` (WebKit and
 * Chromium both do), else at 1x; and the system's of the same meaning
 * behind it, where neither is to be had.
