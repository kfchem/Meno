/**
 * Words on the page written in place (lib/chem/captions; docs/EDITOR-2D.md,
 * *Text*; docs/PDF.md, step 5): drawn by Meno as they will be kept - set
 * as the drawing sets its labels, in its typeface at its size, broken into
 * lines as wide as they are made where they are given a width - with the
 * caret, what is selected and what the IME composes drawn over them, lit
 * round as words under the pointer are. Typed through the field the
 * column's texts are typed through (TextEditor/typingField), kept out of
 * sight and laid at the caret, so that the IME's candidates show there.
 *
 * Where they stand - or, new, where Quick Add or the menu was opened. A
 * click among them puts the caret, two select a word, three a line, a drag
 * selects on - the click or the drag that opened them counted among those.
 * Enter keeps them, Shift+Enter starts another line, Escape lets them go,
 * and a press elsewhere keeps them too. New words put down near an arrow go
 * over it or under it; words written anew over an arrow stay clear of it as
 * they grow. Words written away are gone.
 *
 * What is drawn is drawn whole (Labels2D `WholeTexts2D`): the caret and
 * what is selected go with the words as they are drawn, not ahead of them;
 * and the words written are drawn in place of the caption's own only once
 * they are, and the caption's own again in place of them, once kept or let
 * go, only once those are (`captionLeft`) - never a letter gone, or one
 * too many, for a frame.
