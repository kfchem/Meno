/**
 * A chain traced on its honeycomb (./honeycomb): the walk the pointer leads
 * it on, bond by bond. Pure.
 *
 * - The pointer leads: the chain goes along the honeycomb to the point
 *   nearest it, one bond at a time, each to the next point nearer the
 *   pointer; led back the way it came - or beside it, near enough - it
 *   takes its bonds back again, as far as the point it is led back to.
 * - Led round, along the honeycomb, to a point it has been through - not
 *   straight back the way it came, but round, so that the way the pointer
 *   went encloses room - it closes the ring that way makes: round one
 *   hexagon, a six-membered ring; round two, a ten-membered one; and so on.
 *   Back to such a point without going round, it is taken back to it.
 * - It draws the honeycomb's rings and no other (the maintainer, 2026-10-07
 *   and 2026-10-08): a loop that does not come round to a point of the
 *   chain draws no ring of its own, and a ring of another size is drawn by
 *   hand. A loop is taken as the hand meant it: a way out and back that
 *   encloses only a sliver goes round nothing.
