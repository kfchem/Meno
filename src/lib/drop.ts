/**
 * Drops on the page, handed to the part of it they land on. A part that
 * takes drops - the drawing now; a tab strip, a workflow's node, a 3D view
 * in time - registers as a drop zone (`useDropZone`), and a drag is routed
 * to the zone under it: the zone says whether it takes it, may start
 * reading what it carries as it comes over (Office takes back what it
 * dragged as the drag ends), and is handed the drop.
 *
 * Drags come in two ways, routed alike:
 * - as the page's own drag events, through the webview: files from the
 *   Finder or Explorer on both platforms, and on a Mac everything else too,
 *   whose data the app reads off the drag pasteboard (`readDrop`);
 * - on Windows, a drag from another program that is not of files - an
 *   object or a picture out of Word or PowerPoint. WebView2 keeps what such
 *   a drag carries from the page and from Meno, so as it comes over a zone
 *   that takes it, the app takes it from the webview with a window of its
 *   own over the zone (`drop_catch`, src-tauri/src/drop.rs), reads it, and
 *   tells the page where it goes ("native-drag"); `readDrop` reads what it
 *   read. Off the zone, the webview has it again (text dragged into a
 *   field, say).
 * A drag that starts in the page (a tab, a node) is the page's own, and is
 * not routed.
