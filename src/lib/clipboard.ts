 * A kind of data on the clipboard:
 * - `meno`: Meno's own record of a structure, nothing lost;
 * - `mol`: a MOL file, for other chemistry programs;
 * - `text`: plain text;
 * - `gvml`: Office's own clip format, a package holding a picture that Word
 *   and PowerPoint keep as it is and hand back (lib/office/gvml);
 * - `emf`: an enhanced metafile, for Windows' other programs;
 * - `png`: a PNG;
 * - `dib`: a bitmap, for Windows' programs that take nothing else;
 * - `embed`: on Windows, an object for Office to embed - one a double-click
 *   opens in Meno (src-tauri/src/ole.rs). It is written as the record; the
 *   object is made from that and the `emf` beside it, and read back as the
 *   record again. Elsewhere it is left out. With it, `gvml` and `png` are
 *   left out too: Word and PowerPoint would take either before the object;
 * - `object`: an object Office holds, as Word and PowerPoint for Mac hand it
 *   over when it is copied or dragged - its storage, a compound file (read
 *   with lib/binary/cfb). Only ever read.
 *
 * Plain text is not put beside a structure: without Office's own format
 * beside it, PowerPoint pastes text as a text box in preference to a
 * picture.
