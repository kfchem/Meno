/**
 * Every kind of file Meno takes in, and the one place that says what a
 * file is (docs/FILE-IO.md). Open, a drop and pasted text all ask here,
 * once; what reads the file then is the kind's - Meno itself, or the
 * readers (lib/calc).
 *
 * Meno knows its own kinds only: its workspace and records, the structure
 * files, and the cube, which it reads itself. It knows no program. Every
 * kind of a program's output is brought by the plugins that read it, in
 * their manifests (lib/plugins/manifest), and registered while a plugin
 * that brings it is added - told by marks, text, never a pattern. A mark
 * that would claim one of Meno's own sample files is refused, so that no
 * plugin takes a molfile for its own.
 *
 * A file is told by what it holds, the strongest evidence first:
 * 1. Meno's own records - a workspace, a structure's record;
 * 2. a program's banner - the one that comes first in the file, where it
 *    holds more than one (an output quoting another program's);
 * 3. an RXN file's or a molfile's markers;
 * 4. a PDB file's records;
 * 5. a cube's layout;
 * 6. an XYZ file's layout.
 * Its name decides only where what it holds does not - a molfile Meno
 * cannot make out is still a molfile, and says why it cannot be read - and
 * a kind its plugin tells, asked (`probe`), is asked about last.
