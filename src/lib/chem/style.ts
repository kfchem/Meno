 * A length can be given in points or as a fraction of the bond length,
 * whichever reads better for it - a line's thickness is naturally "0.6 pt",
 * the gap in a double bond "18% of the bond". The bond length itself is in
 * points; it is what every fraction is a fraction of. What belongs to a
 * label - where its baseline sits, how big a subscript is - is a fraction of
 * the label's font size, and an angle is in degrees.
 *
 * A style is chosen as a preset (ACS 1996, RSC, ...) and what was changed
 * from it: a `StyleChoice`. The application has one, a document may have its
 * own instead, and later an atom or a bond may change a setting or two.
 * `resolveStyle` lays changes over a style. What each setting means, in
 * words, is in `styleFields.ts`.
