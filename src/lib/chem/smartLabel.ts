/**
 * A label read as it was meant, from the letters typed (docs/EDITOR-2D.md,
 * *Labels typed in place*; the maintainer, 2026-10-10): nh2 is NH2, obz
 * OBz, hnfmoc NHFmoc. No list of what is typed: the readings are those
 * Meno already reads - the abbreviations, the user's own, those put
 * together by rule, element symbols with their H and charge - and these
 * rules choose among them.
 *
 * 1. A letter typed small may be read as a capital, one typed as a capital
 *    stays one; of the readings, the one that changes the fewest letters
 *    (co is Co, ph Ph, ipr iPr - not the NHC IPr).
 * 2. No element after uranium (Np on) is read from letters typed small:
 *    nh is NH, not nihonium; ts tosyl, not tennessine.
 * 3. A label typed as it is drawn on a bond's left - AcO, BocHN, HO2C, H2N,
 *    or HN before a group - is kept as it reads from the bond: OAc, NHBoc,
 *    CO2H, NH2, NHFmoc.
 * 4. A prefix set in italics gets its hyphen: tBu is t-Bu, CO2tBu CO2t-Bu.
 * 5. What reads as nothing stays as typed.
 *
 * As a label is typed only letters' case changes (`liveLabel`): the same
 * letters, where they were typed, so that the caret stays where it is;
 * rules 3 and 4 are applied as it is kept (`keptLabel`).
