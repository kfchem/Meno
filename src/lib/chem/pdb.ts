/**
 * PDB files read and written as the wwPDB's "Atomic Coordinate Entry Format
 * Version 3.3" describes them (wwpdb.org, format33/): every line a record,
 * its name in columns 1 to 6, its fields in fixed columns.
 *
 * Reading keeps all that the records it reads say - an atom's name,
 * residue, chain and the rest, not only its element and where it is - so
 * that more can be made of a file later than Meno makes of it now. Each
 * record it reads has a handler of its own (`RECORDS`); a record it does
 * not read yet is counted, by name, and a handler is all it takes to read
 * it. What the rest of Meno makes of an entry - molecules in 3D - is its
 * own business (lib/io/structures).
 *
 * Writing writes the coordinate records of molecules in 3D - HETATM, MODEL
 * and ENDMDL, CONECT, END - and nothing an archive entry has besides
 * (HEADER, CRYST1, MASTER...): a file of coordinates, not an entry of the
 * archive.
 *
 * Columns are numbered from 1 here, as the format numbers them.
