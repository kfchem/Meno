/**
 * A text coloured by what it is (docs/PDF.md, *A text*), by a grammar:
 * a Python script, JSON or XML by Lezer's (MIT); a calculation's input or
 * output by its plugin's (lib/plugins/manifest `GrammarDecl`), made into a
 * parser as it is first wanted (./grammars). Each is parsed as far as it is
 * read, and from where it was changed, the rest kept. Meno knows no
 * program's format of itself: its plugins' grammars say it.
 *
 * Each line's colours come as spans of it, each a tone (./tones); Meno
 * draws the tones (TextEditor/linePictures). What does not read as the
 * grammar says is marked, a line's parts at a time (`wrong`).
