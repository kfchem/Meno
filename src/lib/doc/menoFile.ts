 * The workspace file, `.meno` (docs/FILE-IO.md, *The workspace file*): a

 *
 *   mimetype          first, stored: what the file is, for Meno to tell it by
 *   workspace.json    stored: the workspace (Workspace/utils/workspace)
 *   files.json        stored: each file kept - its name, kind, media type, size
 *   files/<sha256>    each file kept, as it was: text deflated, the rest stored
 *
 * The workspace stays plain JSON, uncompressed, so that opening one costs
 * what reading the JSON costs and it reads as it is once unzipped. The files
 * kept - calculations' outputs opened, later PDFs and pictures - are read
 * only when wanted, each by its SHA-256, which is what the workspace knows
 * it by. Nothing is ever unpacked to the disk; what the file says of its
 * sizes is held to limits before anything is inflated.
