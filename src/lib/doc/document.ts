/**
 * Document store: the undoable, saveable state of one tab.
 *
 * Meno's views currently keep their content in their own way (the 2D editor in
 * a Zustand store, the workflow editor in component state), which makes undo a
 * per-view affair and keeps a tab's content out of reach of other views. A
 * document is the other half of that split:
 *
 * - **document state** — atoms and bonds, text, a node graph: undoable, saved,
 *   readable by anything that has the tab;
 * - **ephemeral state** — hover, drag previews, camera, edit buffers: owned by
 *   the view, never undone, never saved.
 *
 * History is kept as snapshots. Updates are immutable, so unchanged parts are
 * shared between snapshots rather than copied, which keeps this cheap for the
 * sizes Meno deals with and avoids the bug surface of inverse operations.
 *
 * Framework-agnostic on purpose: `subscribe` matches React's
 * `useSyncExternalStore`, but nothing here imports React.
